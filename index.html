		<p>
			At my current internship I am working on implanting a user provisioning agent, apart of a lifecycle workflow, to automate tasks such as creating new user AD accounts as well as updating them. Additionally this agent created users in Entra and can assign users to there necessary groups dynamically, and also complies with our RBAC policies. We've decided to use tools like Azure Logic App, and Runbook to automate as well as load balanced Azure Arc Servers for continuation. This allows us to load in thousands of users a week with almost 100% success rate, resulting in no suspended jobs.
